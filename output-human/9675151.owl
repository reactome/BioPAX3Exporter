 <bp:comment rdf:datatype = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Developmental disorders affect formation of body organs and organ systems. The causes of defects in human development are diverse and incompletely understood, and include environmental insults such as nutrient deficiency, exposure to toxins and infections (Gilbert 2000, National Research Council (US) Committee on Developmental Toxicology 2000, Taylor and Rogers 2005, Zilbauer et al. 2016, Izvolskaia et al. 2018), as well as genetic causes such as aneuploidy and other chromosomal abnormalities, and germline mutations in genes that regulate normal development. It is estimated that about 40% of human developmental disabilities can be attributed to genetic aberrations (Sun et al. 2015), of which at least 25% are due to mutations affecting single genes (Chong et al. 2015), and this latter group of Mendelian developmental disorders is the focus of curation in Reactome.  Disorders of nervous system development affect the function of the central nervous system (CNS) and impair motor skills, cognition, communication and/or behavior (reviewed by Ismail and Shapiro 2019). So far,we have annotated the role of loss-of-function mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), an epigenetic regulator of transcription, in Rett syndrome, a pervasive developmental disorder (Pickett and London 2005, Ferreri 2014).  Disorders of myogenesis are rare hereditary muscle diseases that in the case of congenital myopathies are defined by architectural abnormalities in the muscle fibres (Pelin and Wallgren-Pettersson 2019, Phadke 2019, Radke et al. 2019, Claeys 2020) and in the case of muscular dystrophies by increased muscle breakdown that progresses with age (Pasrija and Tadi 2020). Mutations in cadherin family genes are present in some types of muscular dystrophy (Puppo et al. 2015).  Disorders of pancreas development result in pancreatic agenesis, where a critical mass of pancreatic tissue is congenitally absent. For example, the PDX1 gene is a master regulator of beta cell differentiation and homozygous deletions or inactivating mutations in PDX1 gene cause whole pancreas agenesis. PDX1 gene haploinsufficiency impairs glucose tolerance and leads to development of diabetes mellitus (Hui and Perfetti 2002, Babu et al. 2007, Chen et al. 2008).  Left-right asymmetry disorders are caused by mutations in genes that regulate the characteristic asymmetry of internal organs in vertebrates. Normally, cardiac apex, stomach and spleen are positioned towards the left side, while the liver and gallbladder are on the right. Loss-of-function mutations in the CFC1 gene, whose protein product functions as a co-factor in Nodal signaling, result in heterotaxic phenotype in affected patients, manifested by randomized organ positioning (Bamford et al. 2000).  Congenital lipodystrophies are characterized by a lack of adipose tissue, which predisposes affected patient to development of insulin resistance and related metabolic disorders. The severity of metabolic complications is correlates with the extent of adipose tissue loss. Loss-of-function mutations in the PPARG gene, encoding a key transcriptional regulator of adipocyte development and function, are a well-established cause of familial partial lipodystrophy type 3 (FPLD3) (Broekema et al. 2019).  Congenital stem cell disorders are caused by mutations in genes that regulate the balance between stem cells maintenance and commitment to differentiated lineages. Loss-of-function mutations in the SOX2 gene, which encodes a transcription factor involved in the maintenance of totipotency during embryonic preimplantation period, pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, and multipotency of neural stem cells, are the cause of anophthalmia (the absence of an eye) and microphthalmia (the presence of a small eye within the orbit (Verma and Fitzpatrick 2007, Sarlak and Vincent 2016).  HOX-related structural birth defects are caused by loss-of-function mutations in HOX family genes.HOX transcription factors play a fundamental role in body patterning during embryonic development, and HOX mutation are an underlying cause of many congenital limb malformations (Goodman 2002).  Congenital keratinization disorders are caused by dominant negative mutation in keratin genes and depending on where the affected keratin gene is expressed, they affect epithelial tissues such as skin, cornea, hair and/or nails (McLean and Moore 2011).  Disorders of immune system development are caused by mutations in genes that regulate differentiation of blood cell lineages involved in immune defense, leading to immune system defects. For example, mutations in the gene encoding CSF3R, a receptor for the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, result in congenital neutropenia, characterized by a maturation arrest of granulopoiesis at the level of promyelocytes. Patients with severe congenital neutropenia are prone to recurrent, often life-threatening infections from an early age and may be predisposed to myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia (Germeshausen et al. 2008; Skokowa et al. 2017).</bp:comment>

 <bp:comment rdf:datatype = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Neurodevelopmental disorders are chronic disorders that affect the function of the central nervous system (CNS) and impair motor skills, cognition, communication and/or behavior. While these disorders frequently stem from mutations in genes that directly control CNS development, they can also be a consequence of environmental insults such as hypoxic/ischemic injury, trauma, exposure to toxins, infections and nutritional deficiencies, or be indirectly caused by mutations in metabolic genes (reviewed by Ismail and Shapiro 2019). Disorders of nervous system development have been traditionally classified based on phenotypic traits (clinical presentation). Molecular genetics studies have revealed, however, that indistinguishable clinical presentations may result from pathogenic variants in different genes whose protein products function in connected biological pathways. On the other hand, distinct clinical presentations may be caused by pathogenic mutations in a single gene that functions in multiple biological pathways (Desikan and Bakrovich 2018). In the future, phenotype-based classification of neurodevelopmental disorders may be replaced by a more informative pathway-based nomenclature (Desikan and Bakrovich 2018). Biological pathways frequently impaired in neurodevelopmental disorders are signal transduction pathways such as the mTOR pathway in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (Wong 2019) and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway in RASopathies (Kang and Lee 2019), neurotransmission pathways as in some autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (Burnashev and Szepetowski 2015, Hu et al. 2016), and pathways that regulate gene expression as in Mendelian disorders of epigenetic machinery (MDEM) (Fahrner and Bjornsson 2019).  So far,we have annotated the role of loss-of-function mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), an epigenetic regulator of transcription, in Rett syndrome, a pervasive developmental disorder that belongs to the MDEM category (Pickett and London 2005, Ferreri 2014).</bp:comment>

 <bp:comment rdf:datatype = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) largely overlap with the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). PDDs manifest in childhood and mainly affect social interaction, including communication and behavior. PDDs can be caused by mutations in genes involved in brain development and function, environmental insults, or the combination of environmental factors and genetic susceptibility. The pervasive developmental disorder pathway that Reactome has annotated is the &quot;Loss of function of MECP2 in Rett syndrome&quot;.

 <bp:comment rdf:datatype = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Loss of function mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), an epigenetic regulator of transcription, are the major cause of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1 in 10,000-15,000 female births. The symptoms of Rett syndrome appear after 6-18 months of apparently normal postnatal development and include regression of acquired language and motor skills, stereotypic hand movements, intellectual disability, epileptic seizures and respiratory disturbances. Besides Rett syndrome, aberrant MECP2 expression is implicated as an underlying cause of other neuropsychiatric disorders (reviewed by Banerjee et al. 2012, Ebert and Greenberg 2013, Lyst and Bird 2015). Only functionally characterized MECP2 mutations are annotated. For a comprehensive list of MECP2 mutations reported in Rett syndrome, please refer to the RettBASE (http://mecp2.chw.edu.au), a database dedicated to curation of disease variants of MECP2, CDKL5 and FOXG1 in Rett syndrome (Krishnaraj et al. 2017).  The pathway &quot;Loss of MECP2 binding ability to the NCoR/SMRT complex&quot; describes MECP2 loss-of-function mutations reported in Rett syndrome that impair its ability to associate with the NCoR/SMRT complex.  The pathway &quot;Loss of phosphorylation of MECP2 at T308&quot; describe loss-of-function mutations in MECP2 reported in Rett syndrome that impair its ability to undergo phosphorylation at threonine residue 308 in response to neuronal activity.  The pathway &quot;Loss of MECP2 binding ability to 5hmC-DNA&quot; describes MECP2 loss-of-function mutations reported in Rett syndrome that impair the ability of MECP2 to bind to hydroxymethylated DNA.  The pathway &quot;Loss of MECP2 binding ability to 5mC-DNA&quot; describes MECP2 loss-of-function mutations reported in Rett syndrome that impair the ability of MECP2 to bind to methylated DNA.</bp:comment>
