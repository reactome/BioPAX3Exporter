 <bp:comment rdf:datatype = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This event has been computationally inferred from an event that has been demonstrated in another species. The inference is based on the homology mapping from PANTHER. Briefly, reactions for which all involved PhysicalEntities (in input, output and catalyst) have a mapped orthologue/paralogue (for complexes at least 75% of components must have a mapping) are inferred to the other species. High level events are also inferred for these events to allow for easier navigation.  More details and caveats of the event inference in Reactome.
